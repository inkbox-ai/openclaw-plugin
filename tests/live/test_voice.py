"""Live voice-call suite — real phone calls, real model, transcript-verified.

Two scenarios, each run against a gateway booted in the matching speech mode (the
workflow sets that up and selects the scenario via VOICE_SCENARIO):

  * inbound_inkbox   — the driver calls the agent; the agent answers with Inkbox
                       STT/TTS and holds a turn.
  * outbound_realtime — the driver texts "call me"; the agent places a call back,
                       powered by the realtime API, and holds a turn.

A companion driver process (voice_driver.py) bridges the driver's side of the call
over an Inkbox tunnel and speaks one line. We then read the stored call transcript
and assert both parties spoke — proving the agent reached the caller out loud.
