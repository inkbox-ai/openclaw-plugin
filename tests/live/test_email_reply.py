"""Live test: the agent emails back — and the reply is real, not an error.

A *remote* Inkbox identity emails the agent-under-test (AUT). The AUT's running
OpenClaw gateway routes it, "thinks" against a deterministic mock model (see
mock_openai.py — no real LLM, so this is repeatable and free), and emails a reply.

We assert two independent things so a broken setup can't pass:
  1. delivery  — a reply lands in the remote mailbox, tracked by thread_id;
  2. content   — the reply body carries the mock's ``REPLY_OK <nonce>`` marker and
                 contains NO error strings (this is what catches the agent emailing
                 back a model-auth 401 instead of a real reply).

Skipped unless both API keys are present, so it never runs in the offline suite.
Requires the AUT gateway to already be running (the workflow starts it).
