"""Live SMS suite — the same questions as the email suite, over real SMS.

SMS differs from email: agent-to-agent SMS skips the START opt-in (the server
bypasses it for inter-agent traffic), and outbound SMS is subject to carrier +
spam filtering — so prompts ask for SHORT replies and avoid spammy content.

  * mock leg → reachability (deterministic ``REPLY_OK`` from the mock model).
  * real leg → intelligence: basic, own identity, sender, tools.

Skipped unless both keys are set. Replies are matched by *new* inbound message id
