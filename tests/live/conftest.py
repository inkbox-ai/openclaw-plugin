# tests/live/conftest.py
"""Shared guardrails for the live suite.

The live tests drive real SMS through the shared Inkbox 10DLC pool, whose
conversation-health rules (see servers ``conversation_health.py``) block a
sender once its window fills: the same body twice with no reply
(``duplicate_body``), 10 unanswered outbound (``unanswered_limit``), or 5
carrier spam-fails in a row (``carrier_spam_backoff``). Each rule keys off
the window *"since the recipient's last inbound reply"* and empties the
moment an inbound lands in that direction.

``duplicate_body`` is already handled everywhere by per-send body
diversification (each driver send carries a unique ref), and the tests
never provoke real carrier fails, so the only window that creeps up is
``unanswered_limit`` — and only in tests where the agent answers
out-of-band (voice "call me" → the agent *calls* back, never texts), so
nothing resets the opener's window.

Rather than poke an SMS before every test (which spams the real driver
phone), this autouse guardrail only resets when needed: it reads the
opener's current window and, if there's plenty of head-room, does nothing.
Only when the window is close to the cap does it land an inbound on the
opener to empty it — a cheap read per test, an actual SMS rarely.

"Opener" = whoever sends first in the test; the rule blocks the opener on
*their* window, and a window empties only on an inbound to that party, so
the reset lands on the opener. Penetrator opens by default (all current
tests); a test that opens the other way marks itself
``@pytest.mark.first_sender("aut")``.
