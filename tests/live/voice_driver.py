"""Live voice-call driver: the peer on the other end of a real phone call.

Opens an Inkbox tunnel for the driver identity, serves the call-media WebSocket
behind it, and bridges audio in Inkbox STT/TTS mode (text frames only — no local
model). It speaks a scripted line so the agent under test gets a turn, re-asking
while the agent is idle, and the call transcript (read separately by the test)
proves the agent replied.

Run as a standalone process alongside the gateway. On startup it writes a small
JSON state file (its public WS URL + phone-number id) that the test reads to place
or expect a call. Two call directions are supported by the same bridge:
  * the test places a call to the agent and passes this driver's WS URL, or
  * the agent calls this driver's number, which is set to auto-accept onto the
    same WS URL.

Env:
  REMOTE_INKBOX_API_KEY   driver identity key (identity-scoped)
  INKBOX_BASE_URL         API root (default https://inkbox.ai)
  VOICE_DRIVER_PORT       local port the tunnel forwards to (default 8090)
  VOICE_DRIVER_STATE      path to write the JSON state file
  VOICE_DRIVER_LINE       the one line the driver speaks (default below)
  VOICE_DRIVER_ANSWER_SETTLE  seconds to keep media open after hearing the answer
