# Inkbox credential use

When an action requires plaintext credentials (a password, an API key, an SSH key, a TOTP code), use this skill to retrieve them through the Inkbox vault. The vault tools are **all optional** — the user must opt them into `tools.allow` before this skill can do anything.

## Required tools (all optional, must be allowlisted)

- `inkbox_credentials_list` — metadata only (id, name, secretType). Safe to call freely.
- `inkbox_credentials_get_login` — plaintext login (username + password + optional URL)
- `inkbox_credentials_get_api_key` — plaintext API key
- `inkbox_credentials_get_ssh_key` — plaintext SSH private key (+ public, fingerprint, passphrase)
- `inkbox_totp_code` — current TOTP code for a login that has TOTP configured

## Prerequisites

- The vault must be initialized in the Inkbox Console.
- The vault unlock key must be available in the `INKBOX_VAULT_KEY` env var (or a custom env var if `vault.keyEnvVar` is configured).
- The identity must have access grants to the secrets in question (admin-set via the Inkbox Console).

If `INKBOX_VAULT_KEY` is not set, the very first credential tool call returns "Vault is locked." Direct the user to export the env var in the shell launching OpenClaw, then retry.

## Workflow

1. **List first.** Call `inkbox_credentials_list` (optionally filter by `type`). Read the metadata to find the right `id` by `name`. Never guess UUIDs.

2. **Confirm with the user when stakes are high.** If the user said "log into AWS production," verify the matching secret's `name` and `description` look right before fetching plaintext. The agent should not silently pull production credentials.

3. **Fetch the typed plaintext.** Call the matching get tool:
   - Login → `inkbox_credentials_get_login`
   - API key → `inkbox_credentials_get_api_key`
   - SSH key → `inkbox_credentials_get_ssh_key`

   Each returns the payload as JSON. Use the fields directly in the action the user asked for; do not echo the plaintext back to the user unless they explicitly asked to see it.

4. **TOTP** is a separate flow. Call `inkbox_totp_code` with the login secret's UUID — returns `{ code, secondsRemaining }`. The code is valid for `secondsRemaining` seconds; if it's <5, regenerate before using.

## Hygiene

- **Don't list-then-dump.** `credentials_list` returns metadata only by design. Don't call all three `get_*` tools in a loop trying to enumerate the vault.
- **Don't paste plaintext into chat.** When the user asks "use the GitHub PAT to push," fetch it and use it — don't repeat it back to them.
- **Don't store outside this call.** The plugin caches the unlocked vault in-process; you don't need to (and shouldn't) keep plaintext in session memory.

## Errors

| Error | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Vault is locked. Set the INKBOX_VAULT_KEY...` | Env var missing — direct the user to set it. |
| `404` on get_* | Wrong secret id, or this identity doesn't have access. |
| `TypeError` on get_login/get_api_key/get_ssh_key | Caller picked the wrong typed getter for the secret's type. Re-list to see `secretType`. |

## What this skill does NOT cover

- Creating, updating, or deleting secrets — there's no plugin tool for this in agent-scoped mode.
- Granting access to secrets — admin-only via the Inkbox Console.
- TOTP setup — initial TOTP config also happens in the Console.
