# Inkbox troubleshooting

Use this skill when an Inkbox tool fails, the user asks why Inkbox is not working, or a channel readiness problem blocks email, SMS, calls, contacts, notes, or vault access.

## Common errors

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Inkbox plugin is not configured` | Set `apiKey` + `identity` in config, or run `openclaw inkbox setup`. |
| `whoami failed: 401 Unauthorized` | API key is wrong, revoked, or has a typo. Ask the user to mint or paste a fresh key. |
| `whoami: API key is not agent-scoped` | Outbound may work, but access-scoped reads can behave differently. Prefer an agent-scoped key bound to the configured identity. |
| `404` on `getIdentity` | The configured `identity` handle does not exist under this key or does not match the key's bound identity. |
| `sender_sms_pending` | The Inkbox phone number is still propagating to carriers. Retry later and verify `smsStatus`. |
| `recipient_not_opted_in` | Ask the recipient to text `START` to the agent's Inkbox number, then retry. |
| `recipient_opted_out` | The recipient texted `STOP`; they must text `START` again before SMS can be sent. |
| `Vault is locked` | Export `INKBOX_VAULT_KEY=<the vault key>` in the shell launching OpenClaw, or use the configured `vault.keyEnvVar`. |

## Vault unlock pattern

Vault tools are optional and must be allowlisted before use. The plugin never persists the vault key. It reads the key once on first credential access from `INKBOX_VAULT_KEY`, or from the custom env var configured under `vault.keyEnvVar`.

If vault access fails, do not ask for the vault key in chat. Tell the operator which env var needs to be set in the OpenClaw gateway process.

## Identity checks

Use `inkbox_whoami` when you need to confirm the active Inkbox identity, mailbox, phone number, SMS status, auth subtype, sending domain, or call routing state.

If `inkbox_whoami` fails, surface the exact error and suggest `openclaw inkbox doctor` for a local diagnostic pass.
